Hi! I am a PhD candidate at Boston University adivsed by [Prof. Manos Athanassoulis](https://cs-people.bu.edu/mathan/).
My research focuses on Database systems, particularly indexing and access methods. Recently, I have been working on instance-optimized indexes that harness inherent data order or sortedness to improve performance.

Before joining Boston University, I attended [Purdue University Fort Wayne](https://www.pfw.edu/etcs/computer-science) for my bachelors degree.

**I am currently on the job market, looking for full-time opportunities in the industry.**
